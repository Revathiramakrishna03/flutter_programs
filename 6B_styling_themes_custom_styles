b) Apply styling using themes and custom styles.
Description :
In Flutter, styling with themes and custom styles helps maintain a consistent design across the entire app. Instead of manually styling each widget, developers can define a ThemeData that includes colors, fonts, and widget styles like buttons or text. This way, all widgets automatically follow the same design rules, making the UI look professional and uniform. For example, you can set a global button shape or text font once in the theme, and it will apply everywhere in the app. Custom styles can also be created for special widgets when needed, ensuring flexibility along with consistency. This approach reduces repetitive code, simplifies maintenance, and makes it easier to apply branding or switch between light and dark modes.
Program :
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  State<MyApp> createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  bool isDark = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      theme: ThemeData(
        brightness: Brightness.light,
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      darkTheme: ThemeData(
        brightness: Brightness.dark,
        primarySwatch: Colors.deepPurple,
      ),
      themeMode: isDark ? ThemeMode.dark : ThemeMode.light,
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Theme Demo")),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
            children: [
              Text("Hello Flutter!", style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.titleLarge),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () => setState(() => isDark = !isDark),
                child: Text(isDark ? "Switch to Light" : "Switch to Dark"),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
