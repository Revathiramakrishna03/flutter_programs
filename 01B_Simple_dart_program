EXPERIMENT-1
b) Write a simple Dart program to understand the language basics.
Program:
void main() {
  String name = 'John';
  int age = 20;

  print('Name: $name, Age: $age');

  if (age >= 18) {
    print('$name is an adult.');
  } else {
    print('$name is a minor.');
  }

  for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    print('Count: $i');
  }

  greet(name);
}

void greet(String name) {
  print('Hello, $name!');
}

Explanation of Components:
•	void main()
The entry point of every Dart program. The code inside main() runs when the program starts.
•	Variables (String name, int age)
Store data with specific types:
o	String holds text.
o	int holds whole numbers.
•	print()
Displays output in the console. Here it shows the name and age, and messages inside the condition and loop.
•	Conditional statement (if-else)
Executes different code based on a condition.
If age is 18 or older, it prints that the person is an adult; otherwise, it prints that they are a minor.
•	for loop
Repeats a block of code multiple times.
Here, it counts from 1 to 3, printing each number.
•	Function (greet)
A reusable block of code that takes a parameter (name) and prints a greeting message.
It is called from main() with greet(name).
